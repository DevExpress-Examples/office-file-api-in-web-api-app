# Office File API - Use Office File API Libraries as a Back-End in Web-API Applications

This example shows how to create an ASP.NET Core Web API application with the Office File API libraries. The application contains a series of endpoints to perform the following actions:

- Convert Word and Excel files to available formats
- Split Word, Excel and PDF files
- Merge Word, Excel and PDF files
- Password-protect Word, Excel and PDF files

 The project contains a Dockerfile that specifies how to build the application in a Docker container.
