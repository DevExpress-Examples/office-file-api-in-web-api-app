# Office File API - Use DevExpress Office File API Libraries (at the backend) for your Web-API Applications

By following the steps outlined in this example, youâ€™ll create an ASP.NET Core Web API application using DevExpress Office File API libraries. The application will include a series of endpoints designed to perform the following actions:

* Convert Word and Excel files to available formats.
* Split Word, Excel and PDF files.
* Merge Word, Excel and PDF files.
* Password-protect Word, Excel and PDF files.

The project contains a Dockerfile that specifies how to build the application in a Docker container.

## Build the Docker Image

Obtain a [DevExpress NuGet Feed URL](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116042/installation/install-devexpress-controls-using-nuget-packages/obtain-your-nuget-feed-credentials) and add your feed authorization key to the [Dockerfile](./CS/Dockerfile) to specify the package source for the [DevExpress.Document.Processor](https://nuget.devexpress.com/packages/DevExpress.Document.Processor/) NuGet package.

Use the following commands to build and run the docker image:

  ```
  docker build -t officefileapinwebapi .
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 officefileapinwebapi
  ```


> [!Note] 
> You need to purchase a license to use the DevExpress Office File API in production code (DevExpress Office File API Subscription or DevExpress Universal Subscription)
