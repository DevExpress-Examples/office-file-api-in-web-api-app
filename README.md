# Office File API - Use DevExpress Office File API Libraries (at the backend) for your Web-API Applications

By following the steps outlined in this example, youâ€™ll create an ASP.NET Core Web API application using DevExpress Office File API libraries. The application will include a series of endpoints designed to perform the following actions:

* Convert Word and Excel files to available formats.
* Split Word, Excel and PDF files.
* Merge Word, Excel and PDF files.
* Password-protect Word, Excel and PDF files.

The project contains a Dockerfile that specifies how to build the application in a Docker container.


> [!Note] 
> You need to purchase a license to use the DevExpress Office File API in production code (DevExpress Office File API Subscription or DevExpress Universal Subscription)
